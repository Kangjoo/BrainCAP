Codes that were used to generate data and results in Lee et al., bioRxiv, 2023, which was then peer-reviewed and published in PLOS Biology (2024). 
This repository involves the continuing development of this toolkit, whereas the published version of the actual codes used in Lee et al (2024) is available in `https://zenodo.org/records/13251563`

Note that these codes are optimized for local use at Yale University High Performance Computing cluster.
